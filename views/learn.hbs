      <h3>Fan Tipper is a community that rewards creativity.</h3>
      <p>If you are a creator who is doing something great, something that people get value from, and would like to
        allow fans an opportunity to express their gratitude, then we feel Fan Tipper could be of benefit to you.</p>
      <p>If you are a fan that feels that the world is powered by creativity and it’s driven by people who follow their
        passion, you can understand that isn’t always easy. So amazing people deserve to be supported.</p>
      <p>Everyone has the ability to do something great, whether they are fans or creators.</p>
      <p>Fan Tipper is about empowering people to restore the equilibrium. Providing a platform that allows you to
        perform a meaningful gesture of goodwill that is mutually acknowledged. It is also a way for fans to connect
        with creators. Opening a dialogue that enables fans to write comments, or FanPraise, when they tip a creator.
      </p>
      <p>If you know someone who deserves to have their actions acknowledged, let them know that there is a growing
        community ready to connect with the things they love.</p>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>Fan Tipper is a new way to give and receive tips online. Think of it as a digital replacement for the tip jar
        or the buskers' hat. We created it because we think the end of coins shouldn’t be the end of generosity.</p>
      <p>Even in a cashless society, small change can still make a big difference.</p>

      <h3>How do I give a tip?</h3>
      <p>All you have to do is log in or sign up with Facebook, add your credit card details and hey presto! You are
        ready to start tipping. Whenever you see the Fan Tipper icon on a website or in a restaurant or cafe, don’t be
        shy. Check out their creator page, give them a tip and maybe even add a personal message. It's been designed to
        work perfectly on your mobile.</p>

      <h3>Why would I want to tip online?</h3>
      <p>By giving a FanTip on Fan Tipper you are not only giving a financial acknowledgement you are also supporting
        the creator in other ways. Leave a comment and give the creator that warm fuzzy feeling of knowing they have
        your support. Share your tip through facebook or twitter and you will be promoting the creator to your friends.
        Or even if just tipping anonymously, your tip works as a positive review for the creator, helping the creator
        find new fans.</p>
